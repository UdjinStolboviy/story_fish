          "**React is the most popular library for building frontend web applications**. Step-by-step by diving into all the basics, I'll introduce you to advanced concepts as well.\n\nWe'll build the minesweeper application from scratch:\n\n-   setup of the development environment\n\n-   configuration of the React JS app\n\n-   basic algorithms of Minesweeper\n\nStep-by-step we'll build the minesweeper game. **During the course, we'll cover the most important topics**.\n\nFirst will be a configuration of the ReactJS application with Typescript and using build tools Webpack+Babel.\n\nSecond, there're presented **TDD or TLD approaches** that I'll try to practice with you during the coding sessions. Probably you don't have enough experience with the tests, but it's ok, there's still a good way to learn it from the course. When you work with code and cover it with test cases, it provides you with guarantees that your code works as you expected. This is the purpose and benefit of the tests.\\\nTools for testing: **Jest, Stryker, React Testing Library**\n\nAlso, I'll try to cover basic **Typescript** concepts and show you a way to improve these skills. During the coding sessions, we'll cover advanced Javascript techniques to make sense of commonly used JS features.\n\nStorybook is the most popular way to build the components library. From our side, it's the most basic part of the course. We'll install and configure Storybook, which will provide us with a full components spec. This approach is called Components Driven Development.\n\n**CSS--IN-JS, emotion, and Styled-Components** are very powerful toolkits to build UI components. Even very complex components styles can be easily produced and supported by it.\n\nWe'll introduce you to **React Hooks** - it's the basic way to make dynamic UI for the applications.\n\nWe'll make a review of **React Router** v5 and also React Router v6.\\\nLast but not least it's **Redux**. Redux is a beautiful way to manage an application state. **We'll use the Redux-Toolkit library** - it simplifies the work with Redux.\\\n**Check out the full curriculum and free preview videos. Join the course risk-free with a 30-day money-back guarantee!**\\\nSee you on the course!",

          "**TypeScript** is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.\n\nTypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). There are multiple options available for transcompilation. Either the default TypeScript Checker can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.\n\nTypeScript is **JavaScript with syntax for types.**\n\nTypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.\n\nOn the course we quickly create a basic project and then review the most common features\n\n**Who this course is for:**\n\n-   Professional Developers that are looking to keep current by learning the latest programming language of the web development world\n\n-   Backend Developers doing a transition to full stack development\n\n-   Frontend Developers that want to improve their frontend skills\n\n-   Javascript Developers in general that use node as a backend server and would like to learn how to write node in Typescript\n\n-   Javascript Developers looking to learn Typescript",
